# Hi there, I'm Gabriel! 👋

I'm a **Software Engineering Student at PUCPR** with a passion for building systems, solving complex problems, and exploring the intersection of technology and entrepreneurship. I transitioned from Civil Engineering to Software Engineering to focus on what I truly love: creating through code.

### 🚀 What I'm currently working on:
- **MTA:SA Development:** I have extensive experience with **Lua scripting** for Multi Theft Auto, focusing on high-performance RPG/Roleplay systems. I also run **Prime Codes**, where I develop custom resources.
- **Server Management:** Currently managing and developing projects like **Havanna RP**.

### 🛠 Tech Stack & Skills:
- **Languages:** .Lua (for gta), currently expanding into Software Engineering core languages (C#, Java, etc.).
- **Other Interests:** Physics, Calculus, and business logistics.

### 🏎 Beyond the Code:
- **Automotive Enthusiast:** I'm a big fan of car culture. If it involves performance or aesthetic mods, I'm interested.
- **Music:** When I'm not coding, I'm likely playing my guitar or listening to some Beethoven.
- **Future Goals:** I'm working towards a long-term dream of traveling South America in a motorhome after graduation and eventually moving to the USA.
